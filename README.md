Doctor Visit Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes doctor visit data to gain insights into patterns and trends in patient visits. The analysis is carried out using Python and various libraries, and the project was developed and executed in Google Colab for ease of collaboration and resource accessibility.

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze the frequency of doctor visits.
Understand the correlation between patient demographics (age, gender) and visit patterns.
Visualize trends over time, such as the number of visits per month or year.
Provide insights into the most common health issues or diagnoses.
Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
seaborn: For enhanced visualizations and statistical plots.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (if any are applied).
numpy: For numerical operations.
datetime: For date and time manipulation.
